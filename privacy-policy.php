Personal Data may be transferred to or processed in locations outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), some of which have not been determined by the European Commission to have an adequate level of data protection. In that case, for personal data subject to European data protection laws, we take measures designed to provide the level of data protection required in the EU, including ensuring transfers governed by the requirements of the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission, or another adequate transfer mechanism.
Where we receive requests to disclose personal data from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests, including reviewing the legality of any order and challenging the order if there are grounds under the law to do so, before any personal data is disclosed.

Your Rights
Depending on the laws of the jurisdiction governing the processing of your personal data, you may have certain rights under applicable data protection laws including:
1.	Access: You have the right to access personal information that TresVista holds about you;
2.	Rectification: You have the right to ask us to rectify information TresVista holds about you if it is inaccurate or not complete;
3.	Erasure: You can request that TresVista erase your personal data. We will keep basic data to identify you and retain it solely for preventing further unwanted processing;
4.	Restrict Processing: You have the right to ask TresVista to restrict how we process your data. This means we are permitted to store the data but not further process it. We keep just enough data to make sure we respect your request in the future;
5.	Object to processing: Where processing is based on legitimate interests, you have the right to object to TresVista processing your data. TresVista will discontinue processing your data, unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing.  We will keep your basic data to identify you and retain it solely for preventing further unwanted processing;
6.	Portability: Where processing is based on consent or performance of a contract, you have the right to data portability. TresVista must allow you to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes in a safe and secure way without this effecting the usability of your data. This right only applies to personal data that you have provided to TresVista as the data controller.
Please contact us to request access, rectification, or erasure, or to restrict processing, to object to processing, to request data portability. Subject to legal considerations or certain exemptions, we may not always be able to address your request, for example, if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way. Please contact us by email to ensure your request is received in a timely manner.

Automated Decision Making
Automated decisions are defined as decisions about individuals that are based solely on the automated processing of data and that produce legal effects that significantly affect the individuals involved.
TresVista does not make automated decisions using personal data. If automated decisions are to be made, affected persons will be given an opportunity to express their views on the automated decision in question and object to it.

Providing Information to TresVista
If you choose not to provide certain personal information, it may be an impediment to the exchange of information necessary for the execution of the contract or provision of Services, and we may not be able to provide you with some services and you may not be able to participate in some of the activities on our Website.

Your Rights and Choices
The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.
Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights
You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will disclose to you:
1.	The categories of personal information we collected about you;
2.	The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you;
3.	Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information;
4.	The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information;
5.	The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request);
6.	If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:
a.	sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and
b.	disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.
Deletion Request Rights
You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:
1.	Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;
2.	Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;
3.	Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;
4.	Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law;
5.	Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.);
6.	Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent;
7.	Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;
8.	Comply with a legal obligation;
9.	Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.
Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights
To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please contact us.
Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
1.	provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative;
2.	describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
Response Timing and Format
We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response electronically. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
Non-Discrimination
We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
1.	deny you goods or services;
2.	charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;
3.	provide you a different level or quality of goods or services;
4.	suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
